    <br /> <br /><p>Sun-Chi Herbal Oil is prepared from the
    extracts of seven different herbs and roots blended in a base oil and mixed
    with alcohol, to give the “natural herbal remedy” for Rheumatoid Arthritis.
    <br /><br />It is used externally, to relieve rheumatic pain through HBFS Therapy. <br />Regular use of Sun-Chi Herbal Oil over a time can even
    cure the effects, (such as growth of bone) due to rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
    <p>Sun-Chi Herbal Paste is a concentrate of the herbal Oil ingredients in the
    form of a paste. Sun-Chi Herbal Paste is a remedy for advanced stages of
    rheumatic arthritis and joint pains. In many cases it has even been proven
    to repair hairline fractures of bones.</p>

      <h3>What is HBFS Therapy</h3><br />
      Hannas Blood Flow Stimulation Therapy (HBFS) involves opening up of the arteries and veins by applying Sun-Chi herbal oil on the effected body parts.<br /><br />
<span><img
  src="images/bloodflow.png" width="600" height="334" alt=""
  class="img-responsive img-center img-border-x4"/></span>
  <br /><br />When Sun-Chi Oil is rubbed on the body
  part which is effected – wrists, knees, hip joints, shoulders, muscles – the
  arteries and veins open up and allows the blood to flow through them. That
  supplies the life giving oxygen and nutrients to the cells in the muscles and joints.
  Consequently the inflammation, which had developed because of lack of blood
  flow to those areas, subsides, taking away the pain.<br /><br />Depending upon
  the severity of each case, the therapy can range from
  10 days to 20 or even 30 days.<br /><br />The regularity of the therapy and
  the time period of 10, 20 or 30 days has proven to be essential for the “mind”
  to register and memorize the improved blood flow routine in the body.

  <div class="well well-sm"><h4 class="text-center">Testimonials</h4><hr>
  <p>Some of the patients who got cured using Sun-Chi Herbal Oil and Sun-Chi Herbal Paste in the past 25 years.</p>
  <p><blockquote><small><strong>Mr. Partab Singh</strong><br /><u>Calgary, Canada(1994)</u><br /><br />
  "I could not walk straight because of my knees. A friend referred me to a visiting therapist from Sweden who treated me for 10 days with HBFS Terapy. My pain in the knees was gone and has never come back. Thanks to Sun-Chi miracle oil."
  </small></blockquote>
  <blockquote><small><strong>Ms. Helfrid</strong><br /><u>Gothenburg, Sweden(1997)</u><br /><br />
  "I was on my way to have my right hip operated in Gothenburg Sahlgranska Hospital. Just a month before the operation, I met Rehana who suggested I should try HBFS Therapy and might avoid the surgery. After 20 days of HBFS Therapy I could run up the stairs of my apartment in spite of my 80 years."
  </small></blockquote>
  <blockquote><small><strong>Mrs. Najma</strong><br /><u>Gothenburg, Sweden(2005)</u><br /><br />
  "Thanks to Rehana for treating me with her special HBFS Therapy. It took just 20 days of treatment and I avoided hip surgery."
  </small></blockquote>
  <blockquote><small><strong>Ms. Fia</strong><br /><u>Hindås, Sweden(2014)</u><br /><br />
  "I was suffering from frozen shoulder for so many months which effected my work. I also had pain in my right heel. One of my friend told me about Rehana who could treat my frozen shoulder within a few days. I got the HBFS Therapy on my shoulder for 10 days and could move my arm all around. Thanks to Rehana."
  </small></blockquote>
  <blockquote><small><strong>Ms. Afsar</strong><br /><u>Gothenburg, Sweden(2014)</u><br /><br />
  "I had a severe problem of inflammation of different parts of my body. I met Rehana through a mutual friend. She was very kind to come and give me treatment at my house for so many days. She used a special oil which did the magic. The inflammation was gone in a few days and I am well again."

    <div class="col-lg-4 bg-02 left-padding"> <blockquote> <p>What is Rheumatoid
    Arthritis (RA)</p>  <small>RA is a chronic disease of unknown cause affecting
    millions of adults world wide. An inflammatory disease of the “synovium” it
    results in pain, stiffness, swelling, deformity and eventually loss of
    function in the joints. <br /><mark>(Oxford Journals Rheumatology – Vol. 42,
    Issue 5, Page 652 – 659).</mark><br /><br /><span><img
    src="images/ra.png" width="357" height="344" alt=""
    class="img-responsive img-center img-border-x4"/></span><br /> As there is no known cure or
    means of preventing RA, <mark>the American College of Rheumatology</mark>
    recommends the earliest possible diagnosis and treatment with disease
    modifying anti-rheumatic agents to limit the degree of irreversible joint
    damage. “Despite early detection, current treatment medications are limited
    in their efficacy and are frequently toxic” Patients, 60% to 90% look for
    “complementary and alternative medicines” (CAM) options in coping with this
    debilitating disease. <br /><br /> Although the cause of rheumatoid
    arthritis is unknown, autoimmunity plays a pivotal role in both its
    chronicity and progression, and RA is considered a systemic autoimmune
    disease. About 1% of the world’s population is afflicted by rheumatoid
    arthritis, women three times more often than men. Onset is most frequent
    between the ages of 40 and 50, but people of any age can be affected. It can
    be a disabling and painful condition, which can lead to substantial loss of
    functioning and mobility if not adequately treated. <br /><br /><span
    class="txtcolor-8d">The good news is that, there is a “remedy” not only for
    this “debilitating disease” – RA, but much more. Since 1992, hundreds of
    patients in Sweden, United States, Canada, Germany, Holland, United Kingdom,
    Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, have found relief from their rheumatic pain
    and arthritis; others cured their “frozen shoulder”, still others were able
    to avoid knee joint operation and hip joint operation. Many sportsmen got
    their injuries and muscular pains cured by the use of <u>Sun-Chi HERBAL OIL &
    Sun-Chi HERBAL PASTE</u></span> </small> </blockquote> <blockquote><p>What
    is, and what Causes Frozen Shoulder?</p> <small>Frozen shoulder (adhesive
    capsulitis) is stiffness, pain, and limited range of movement in your
    shoulder.  It may happen after an injury or overuse or from a disease such
    as diabetes or a stroke. The tissues around the joint stiffen, scar tissue
    forms, and shoulder movements become difficult and painful. The condition
    usually comes on slowly, then goes away slowly over the course of a year or
    more. <br /><br /><span><img
    src="images/fs.png" width="475" height="300" alt=""
    class="img-responsive img-center img-border-x4"/></span><br />The tissues around the joint stiffen, scar tissue forms, and
    shoulder movements become difficult and painful. The condition usually comes
    on slowly, then goes away slowly over the course of a year or more.<br /><br />
    Frozen shoulder occurs: <ul> <li>After surgery or injury.</li> <li>Most
    often in people 40 to 70 years old.</li> <li>More often in women (especially
    in postmenopausal women) than in men.</li> <li>Most often in people with
    chronic diseases.</li> </ul> <u>How is frozen shoulder diagnosed?</u><br />
    Your doctor may suspect frozen shoulder if a physical exam reveals limited
    shoulder movement. An X-ray may be done to see whether symptoms are from
    another condition such as arthritis or a broken bone.<br /> Treatment for
    frozen shoulder usually starts with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    (NSAIDs) and application of heat to the affected area, followed by gentle
    stretching. <br />Ice and medicines (including corticosteroid injections)
    may also be used to reduce pain and swelling. And physical therapy can help
    increase your range of motion.<br /> <br />A frozen shoulder can take a year
    or more to get better. If treatment is not helping, surgery is sometimes
    done to loosen some of the tight tissues around the shoulder. <br /> Experts
    don't know what causes some cases of frozen shoulder, and it may not be
    possible to prevent these. <br /><br /> <span class="txtcolor-8d">As opposed
    to the above, “Sun-Chi Oil & Paste Therapy” cures frozen shoulder in 20
    days.</span></small></blockquote> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
