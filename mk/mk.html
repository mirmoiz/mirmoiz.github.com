	  <span><strong>My great great grand mother brought this zari and alams from Karbala. I am the 4<sup>th</sup> generation to care for them. </strong><br /><br />
	  We are looking to refurbish the zari and alams and are now setting them up to be kept at Imam Bargah Baqi Tul Allah in Karachi for the foreseeable future.<br /><br /></span>
	  <img src="images/bqta2.jpg" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Baqi Tul Allah"/><br /><br />
	  <span>The layout for the new setup is conceptualized as below. It is designed such that the whole assembly is easily cared for and well maintained over many years to come. <br />
	  The new permanent setup will allow for a lot of people to continually be able to pay their respects to the zari and alams.</span>
